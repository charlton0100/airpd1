      <H2> Wellbeing</h2>
      <p>
       The health as defined by <em><a href="https://www.who.int/about/accountability/governance/constitution">World Health Organization</a></em> like “a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” Three dimensions were expressed as interconnected where lack of one dimension can disrupt health as it should be. The <strong>wellbeing</strong> is not far from the health as defined by WHO, but some dimensions were added to match the current situation and improve the health of people. Some added dimensions were emotional, professional or occupational, financial and environmental conditions.<br> <br>
Although wellbeing was then defined differently, all definitions have common ground of being comfortable, happy, productive in a daily basis. The first definition was “the state of feeling healthy and happy”; the second definition was “the combination of feeling good and functioning well”; The third definition was “the experience of health, happiness, and prosperity.” The fourth definition of Wellbeing is a “multi-dimensional concept where the person mental health values, feeling valued, work–life balance are acceptable”; The fifth definition of wellbeing is “a complex combination of a person's physical, mental, emotional and social health factors”. However, World health organization defined the wellbeing as “encompasses quality of life and the ability of people and societies to contribute to the world with a sense of meaning and purpose.”<br><br>
The current life has been affected by new working fictive environment and changing social life, rapidly changing, and flying visions and very demanding way of work with moving targets. Pressure over pressure, meetings wherever you are on electronic gadgets for catching up with deadlines to ensure that all projects are successful. Economic recession, continuous inflation of prices, layoffs, and sleep deprivation, as well as the pandemic are other issues that increase the job insecurity, stress, and burnout. In addition, anxiety, depression, forgetfulness, and stroke may jeopardize the whole life of people. Moreover, the increase of non-communicable diseases caused by lack of wellbeing on their daily basis make their life difficult and reduce their contribution to the world.<br> <br>

      </p>
     
      
      <h2>Wellbeing dimensions:</h2>
     <p>
     As defined above wellbeing must be addressed through different dimensions so that its context meets the heightened and required health and wellbeing. Although many dimensions were mentioned world health organization grouped some in mental health as an integral part of all required reasoning actions. Stoewen in 2017 grouped eight dimensions for improving the wellness of people.
